# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

I don't necessarily agree with everything listed here. But I do believe those thought-provoking resources will help you in your manager journey.

## Code reviews

* [Ask HN: How do you review code?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11416746): great discussion on HackerNews, full of interesting ideas.
* [Maslow's pyramid of code reviews](http://blog.d3in.org/post/111338685456/maslows-pyramid-of-code-review)

## Concepts

* [Availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic): "a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision" (Wikipedia).
* [Broken window theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)
* [Bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect): "cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders."
* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations". [Read the original paper](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)
* [Fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error): "the tendency for people to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) to explain someone else's behavior in a given situation rather than considering the situation's external factors" (Wikipedia).
* [Hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias): "the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it" (Wikipedia).
* [Learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)
* Maslow's Pyramid
* [Outcome bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias): "an error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known" (Wikipedia).
* [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): "for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes".
* [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma): "a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely "rational" individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so."
* [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons): "a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently and rationally according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource."
* [Volunteer's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer%27s_dilemma): "a situation in which each of X players faces the decision of either making a small sacrifice from which all will benefit, or freeriding."
