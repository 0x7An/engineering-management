# Books

More than any other field, management is full of fluffy books that could be summarized in one 100-word article. That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.

## Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders

[Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) is hands down my preferred management book.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.

It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.

There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.

You can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8).

# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.
