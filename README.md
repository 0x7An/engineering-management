# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

## Team vision

* Seth Godin, [A manifesto for small teams doing important work](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/a-manifesto-for-small-teams-doing-important-work.html): really inspiring list of short cultural values for a team. Craft your own!

## Team culture

Those are considered classics:

* [Valve Employee Handbook](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
* [Netflix Culture Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)

## Strategy

Shameless plug here, two presentations I contributed to:

* [Amazon: the hidden empire](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/amazoncom-the-hidden-empire)
* [Apple: 8 easy steps to beat Microsoft](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/apple-study-8-easy-steps-to-beat-microsoft-and-google)
