# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

## Concepts

* [Availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic): "a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision" (Wikipedia).
* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations".
* [Fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error): "the tendency for people to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) to explain someone else's behavior in a given situation rather than considering the situation's external factors" (Wikipedia).
* [Learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)
* [Broken window theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)
* [Hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias): "the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it" (Wikipedia).
* [Outcome bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias): "an error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known" (Wikipedia).

## Feedback & performance

* [Radical Candor â€” The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)

## Learning & retro & postmortem

* [This is How Effective Leaders Move Beyond Blame](http://firstround.com/review/this-is-how-effective-leaders-move-beyond-blame/)

## Project management methodologies

* Jason Yip, [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html): standup are a pretty controversial topics. This article on Martin Fowler's blog provides a good list of patterns and anti-patterns to ensure they're a good productive use of everybody's time.

## Team vision

* Seth Godin, [A manifesto for small teams doing important work](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/a-manifesto-for-small-teams-doing-important-work.html): really inspiring list of short cultural values for a team. Craft your own!

## Team culture

Those are considered classics:

* [Valve Employee Handbook](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
* [Netflix Culture Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)
