# Books

More than any other field, management is full of fluffy books that could be summarized in one 100-word article. That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.

## Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders

[Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) is hands down my preferred management book.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.

It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.

There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.

You can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8).

## Other books

* [The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ORWT3Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1).
* Oren Ellenbogen, [Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook](http://leadingsnowflakes.com/): some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility.

# What is engineering management?

Here are some generic resources:

* [Unintuitive Things I’ve Learned about Management](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b#.2z9av4pzs)
* [Thoughts on Building Weatherproof Companies](http://a16z.com/2016/03/25/building-weatherproof-companies/): while originally aimed at startups CEOs, this article from Andreessen Horowitz's blog is a very inspiring read on what it takes to scale your team.

# General management resources

* [14 Points for Management](https://www.deming.org/theman/theories/fourteenpoints) by W. Edwards Deming.
* [Keith Rabois on the Role of a COO, How to Hire and Why Transparency Matters](http://firstround.com/review/Keith-Rabois-on-the-role-of-a-COO-how-to-hire-and-why-transparency-matters/) includes some nice management nuggets.

[Tal Bereznitskey](https://hackernoon.com/managing-engineers-in-less-than-200-characters-edb35e4199e4#.n8wruugqz)'s awesome definition for managing engineers:

> Hire motivated people. Trust them. Set high standards for everything. Lead by example. Get out of their way and let them be the heroes of the day. That’s it.

## Articles

* [The Quiet Crisis unfolding in Software Development](https://medium.com/@billjordan1/the-quiet-crisis-unfolding-in-software-development-cffbdafbf450#.uy7x227pc)

# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

I don't necessarily agree with everything listed here. Actually, you'll see that some of those articles have diametrically opposed opinions. I do believe those thought-provoking resources will help you in your manager journey.

## Antipatterns

* [Seven Deadly Diseases of Management](https://www.deming.org/theman/theories/deadlydiseases), Dr. Deming. Great video as well. I don't necessarily agree with everything but Deming is still one of the great management thinker.

## Biases

Cognitive biases don't only apply to hiring... They can impact performance reviews, 1-1, team meetings, even small talk with colleagues.

## TV Shows

Netflix's [Chef's table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table) profiles a couple world-renown chef. The kitchen world bears a lot of similarities with management. In the season two, I especially recommend episode 1 and 3:

* [Alex Atala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Atala)'s story shows that you need to constantly reinvent and disrupt yourself.
* [Dominique Crenn](http://www.ateliercrenn.com/) explains how she was given ownership over her work in her first kitchen experience (where she was basically given just a dish name, a list of ingredients, and was expected to invent the recipe with no kitchen training). She replicated that in her own kitchen.

# Keeping up-to-date: blogs and newsletters

Here are some blogs and newsletter I follow.

## Newsletter

* [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) (Oren Ellenbogen): a short curation of great management articles. Also include some videos, and some less serious, funny material. A lot of the links founds in this repo appeared in Oren's weekly email.

## Blogs

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): mandatory if you want to stay abreast of what's going in tech. There are some good management articles from time to time as well. Since it can be a pretty huge time sink, I subscribe to a curation of the top articles instead ([RSS feed here](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/index.rss)).
