# Engineering Management Resources

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

## Concepts

* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations".
* [Learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)
* [Broken window theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)

## Feedback & performance

* [Radical Candor â€” The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)

## Project management methodologies

* Jason Yip, [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html): standup are a pretty controversial topics. This article on Martin Fowler's blog provides a good list of patterns and anti-patterns to ensure they're a good productive use of everybody's time.

## Team vision

* Seth Godin, [A manifesto for small teams doing important work](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/a-manifesto-for-small-teams-doing-important-work.html): really inspiring list of short cultural values for a team. Craft your own!

## Team culture

Those are considered classics:

* [Valve Employee Handbook](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
* [Netflix Culture Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)
* [The HubSpot Culture Code: Creating a Company We Love](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/The-HubSpot-Culture-Code-Creating-a-Company-We-Love.aspx)

## Strategy
